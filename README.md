# Password_Picker
This is a project which makes 3 passwords for you randomly. It has a loop that gives you three paswords every time. After you run it first time it asks you if you want another three paswords or not. If you type 'n' then the loop breaks. It chooses an adjective from the adjectives list, a noun from the nouns list, a random number between 0 and 100 and two punctuations and adds them together. The order to mix them is : punctuation + adjective + noun + number + punctuation. And the passwords are creative ðŸ˜‡  Hope you like this project ðŸ’–

# Password_Picker
This is a project which makes 3 passwords for you randomly. It chooses an adjective from the adjectives list, a noun from the nouns list, a random number between 0 and 100 and two punctuations and adds them together. The order to mix them is : punctuation + adjective + noun + number + punctuation. And the passwords are creative ðŸ˜‡
